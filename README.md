# allInOne - BufrValidationDashboard with 3 decoders on board

![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/mheene/allInOne.svg?branch=master)

The following Docker Container provides you the BufrValidationDashboard with the 3 BUFR Decoder libECBUFR, Geo::BUFR and BUFRDC on board.

With the help of the BUFR validation dashboard users could now easily check a BUFR with different decoders and receive warnings/errors of each decoder. An online demonstrator is available here

Docker
======
If you have docker installed simply type

`docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/usr/local/bufr: -w /usr/local/bufr --name allinone -p 8080:8080 mheene/allinone`

Now open in a browser the [dashboard](http://localhost:8080)

That's it. The dashboard and decoders run in a tomcat container on your computer on port 8080. Simply klick on the landing page the link for the dashboard or one of the 3 decoders.

If you want to use on the 3 decoders directly, please access the container by

`docker exec -it allinone bash`

You are now inside of the container in the directory /usr/local/bufr which is your working directory where you started the container. So put all your BUFRs into this directory which is accessible from inside of the container.


BUFRDC

`bufr_decode_all -i myBufr.bin | more`

Geo::BUFR

`bufrread.pl --strict_checking 6 --verbose 99 myBufr.bin | more`

libECBUFR

`bufr_decoder -strict -inbufr myBufr.bin  | more`




Perhaps you don't have docker and you simply want to get a glimpse into it. Just try this (Docker account needed - you can create your Docker ID [here](https://hub.docker.com/) ):

It runs docker in your browser and pulls the images and runs the dashboard.

In that case the links of the result page point to your local decoders.

Your feedback is highly welcomed.
